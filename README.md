# Labor Discrimination Prediction

## Project Breakdown
- Task: Predicting discrimination based off of linguistic cues within a job ad.
- Initial Methodologies: Bag of words method and probit regression to learn if any words are statistically significant. 
- Initial Model: Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors
- Deep Learning: LSTM Classification using word embeddings taken from the Wikipedia Corpus.
- Further Exploration: Expand dataset to reduce class imbalance and incorporate different types of discrimination, train a word embeddings solely on our Craigslist Corupus, and refine LSTM Model.


### System Requirements
- Linux OS
- Nvidia GPU + CUDA CuDNN (Trained using a GTX 1070)
